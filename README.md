# Cheqq - Habit Tracker

The project is a habit tracker app that also has functions of a social network. Users can create an account, create/choose a selection of habits that they want to participate in and check off completed habits each day. The app is called Cheqq.

There are graphs showing your progress, both in the current week and across the last seven natural days.

## About us

## API

This project mimics an API through an internal route so that we can fetch the json data through axios and display it through a chart.js graph.

## Nodemailer

We use nodemailer for sending an email welcoming each user after signup, and also safe password retrieval is thoroughly implemented thanks to email sending.
